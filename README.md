# DESCRIPTION:
This project features a simple web page built in React that displays user-generated vinyl cover art. The app will ask the user for a band name (real or fictitious) and provide a keyword search to load images from Pexel's API (https://www.pexels.com/api/documentation/?locale=en-US). The resulting selection will genereate the user's compiled vinyl cover on demand.

# MVP:
• Single web page with a header, main and footer\
• Inputs: 1. Enter band name, 2. Search image keyword\
• Output: Display vinyl cover, with band name and image compiled\

Error handling:\
• Max. characters for inputs\
• Error messaging when search turns up no results (either not found or an empty string)\
• Reset button to clear inputs

# STRECTH GOALS:
• Store vinyl covers in a Firebase database. The user can then decide to remove the image 
  from the database on output\
• For the Pexels image results, the user could be presented with a selection of images to 
  choose from
